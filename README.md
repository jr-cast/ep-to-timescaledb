# EP timeseries 

Time series in EnergyPlus are given in CVS, TAB or TXT files to facilitate
readability an data exchange. However, as AECO industry is currently constrainted 
to file-based methodologies, interoperability at data-level among
stakeholders represents an obstacle. 
In the BEM community this is reflected
by the lack of integration of simulation outputs into 
different stages of a building life cycle. 

To address data-level interoperability, the use of 
Semantic Web Technologies (SWT) is gainining traction. SWT permit the 
creation of linked-data models over the web under W3C standards 
(RDF, OWL, SPARQL, SKOS); facilitating understanding among 
disperse and heterogenous data sources.

BEM community can take advantage of SWT and transfer simulated data
to linked building representations, and thus, establish more
integrated approaches to BEM/AECO practice. These outputs can be
embedded into semantic descriptions to be retrieved/queried 
by other stakeholders. 

This is an example of how [EnergyPlus](https://energyplus.net/) simulation 
outputs can be analysed and shared throughout different linked-data models.
The exercise uses some of the scripts provided in 
[Gabe Fierro's data retrieval demo](https://github.com/gtfierro/brick-data-retrieval-demo).
